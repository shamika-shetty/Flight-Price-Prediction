# Flight Price Prediction

Analyzing the flight fare prediction using Machine Learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and many more.

Feature Enginerring and EDA is performed on features.

Here we used Random Forest Regressor model to predict the flight price and with Hyper Parameter tunning we selected best parameters and our model renders an accurancy of 83.74%

Learning curve is plotted to visualize train and test accuracy.
